# FNN_Implementation
Implement a feedforward neural network (FNN) model to classify the MNIST dataset.

Design a FNN model architecture with 2 hidden layers and perform the random initialization for model weights. 
The first hidden layer contains 100 neurons and the second one contains 150 neurons. 
Run backpropagation algorithm and use mini-batch SGD (stochastic gradient descent) to optimize the parameters. Use cross-entropy loss loss function.
